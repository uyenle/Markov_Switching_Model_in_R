MARKOV-SWITCHING ARMA MODELS
The introduction of Markov switching model by Hamilton (1989) is one of the most popular nonlinear time series models in the literature, which appears to properly fit data which changes patterns in different time interval. This model involves multiple structures that can characterize the time series behaviours in different regimes. By allowing switching between regimes, this model is suitable to capture more complex dynamic patterns.
